# Audio Processing Toolkit

The Audio Processing Toolkit is a Python-based project that provides a collection of tools and functionalities for working with audio files. This toolkit allows you to perform various operations such as audio file format conversion, volume adjustment, signal visualization, and more.

## Features

- Audio File Format Conversion: Convert audio files between different formats, including WAV and MP3. The toolkit utilizes the `wave` and `pydub` libraries to handle file input and output.

- Volume Adjustment: Modify the volume of audio files by increasing or decreasing the dB level. You can easily adjust the volume to enhance or normalize audio files.

- Signal Visualization: Visualize audio signals in a waveform format using the `matplotlib` library. Gain insights into the characteristics of the audio signals and analyze their patterns.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Audio Processing Toolkit, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-processing-toolkit.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the example scripts or integrate the toolkit into your own projects.

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use the toolkit:

1. Convert audio file formats:

   ```python
   from pydub import AudioSegment

   audio = AudioSegment.from_wav("input.wav")
   audio.export("output.mp3", format="mp3")
   ```

2. Adjust audio volume:

   ```python
   from pydub import AudioSegment

   audio = AudioSegment.from_wav("input.wav")
   audio = audio + 6  # Increase volume by 6 dB
   audio.export("output.wav", format="wav")
   ```

3. Visualize audio signal:

   ```python
   import wave
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import numpy as np

   obj = wave.open("input.wav", "rb")
   sample_freq = obj.getframerate()
   n_samples = obj.getnframes()
   signal_wave = obj.readframes(-1)
   obj.close()

   signal_array = np.frombuffer(signal_wave, dtype=np.int16)
   times = np.linspace(0, n_samples / sample_freq, num=n_samples)

   plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))
   plt.plot(times, signal_array)
   plt.title("Audio Signal")
   plt.ylabel("Signal wave")
   plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
   plt.xlim(0, n_samples / sample_freq)
   plt.show()
   ```
